Download Windhawk from windhawk.net and install it.
Go to "Mods" in the upper right menu.
Find and install the "Windows 11 Taskbar Styler" mod as well as the "Taskbar height and icon size
" mod.

Manual installation
The theme styles need to be imported manually. To do that, follow these steps:

Place the "StartOrbs" folder in your C drive.  (or edit the shortcuts path in the .json files)
Open the Windows 11 Taskbar Styler mod in Windhawk.
Go to the "Advanced" tab.
Copy the contents of the desired ".json" file to the text box under "Mod settings" and click "Save".

Same thing for the Taskbar height and icon size mod.
